To deploy an application to Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) App Engine, you can use the `gcloud` command-line tool. Below are the basic steps to deploy your application:

### Prerequisites
1. **Install `gcloud` SDK**: If you haven't installed `gcloud` SDK, you can download it from the [Google Cloud SDK page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

2. **Authenticate and Set Project**: Run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate and select the project where you want to deploy the application: `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.

### Basic Deployment Steps
1. **Navigate to Your Application Directory**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your application files are located.

2. **Deploy Your Application**: Run the following command to deploy your application to App Engine:
   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

3. **Review and Confirm**: When prompted, review the changes that will be deployed and confirm the deployment.

4. **Access the Deployed Application**: After the deployment is complete, you can access the deployed application using the URL provided in the output of the `gcloud app deploy` command.

### Example
Suppose you have a Node.js application in a directory named `my-app`. To deploy this application to App Engine, navigate to the `my-app` directory and run the deployment command:
```bash
cd my-app
gcloud app deploy
```

This command will deploy your application to App Engine based on the settings in the application's configuration files.

### Additional Considerations
- Ensure your application's code and configuration files are set up correctly for deployment to App Engine.
- Review the logs and deployment details to verify the success of the deployment.

By following these steps, you can deploy your application to Google Cloud Platform's App Engine using the `gcloud` command-line tool.
