To build a Docker image and push it to Google Container Registry (GCR), here's a basic guide that you can include in a README file:

### Building and Pushing a Docker Image to GCR

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure that you have Docker installed locally and that you are authenticated to Google Cloud using the `gcloud` command-line tool.

2. **Dockerfile**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project. This file defines the steps needed to build your Docker image.

   Example `Dockerfile`:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
   FROM node:14

   # Set the working directory
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install app dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the application code
   COPY . .

   ENV PORT=8080

   # Expose the port
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["node", "app.js"]
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile`. Run the following command to build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[IMAGE_NAME] .
     ```

4. **Push the Docker Image to GCR**:
   - After the image is built, push it to Google Container Registry using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker push gcr.io/[PROJECT_ID]/[IMAGE_NAME]
     ```

5. **Deploy the Docker Image**:
   - Use the pushed image to deploy your application to Google Cloud services, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Google Cloud Run.

6. **Accessing the Image**:
   - Once the image is pushed to GCR, it can be accessed and used in various Google Cloud services that support containerized applications.

By including these steps in the README file, you provide a clear guide for building and pushing a Docker image to Google Container Registry, allowing others to understand the process for deploying containerized applications on Google Cloud Platform.
