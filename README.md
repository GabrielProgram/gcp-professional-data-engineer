<h1 style="color:green">Google Cloud Platform- Professional Data Engineer </h1>

## 
A Professional Data Engineer makes data usable and valuable for others by collecting, transforming, and publishing data. This individual evaluates and selects products and services to meet business and regulatory requirements. A Professional Data Engineer creates and manages robust data processing systems. This includes the ability to design, build, deploy, monitor, maintain, and secure data processing workloads.

The Professional Data Engineer exam assesses your ability to:

- Design data processing systems
- Ingest and process data
- Store the data
- Prepare and use data for analysis
- Maintain and automate data workloads
- Design for reliability
- Design for security and compliance
- Analyze data and enable machine learning

##  Test format
- The exam consists of 50 questions that must be answered in 2 hours.
- The questions are either multiple choice (pick one correct answer) or multiple answer (pick M of N possible answers). Questions can be marked for review later.
- The multiple choice questions are "classic" in the sense that two of the answers can be eliminated immediately. Some detail in the question will bias the choice of the remaining answers.
- The exam is taken on a computer and you will not have access to pen and paper.
- The screen is split in half. The left side contains the questions while the right side contains the case studies.
- The two case studies that are published online were the two case studies used in the exam. The exam is setup so that all of the questions pertaining to a particular case study appear together.
