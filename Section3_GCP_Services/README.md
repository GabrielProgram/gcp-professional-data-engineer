Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offers several basic infrastructure services to support computing, networking, and storage needs. Here are some key services in this category:

1. **Compute Services**:
   - **Compute Engine**: Provides scalable virtual machines that run on Google's infrastructure.
   - **App Engine**: A fully managed platform for building and deploying web applications and APIs.
   - **Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Managed Kubernetes service for orchestrating containerized applications.

2. **Storage Services**:
   - **Cloud Storage**: Object storage that allows you to store and access data on Google's infrastructure.
   - **Cloud SQL**: Fully managed relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.

3. **Networking**:
   - **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Provides networking functionality for GCP resources, allowing you to create and manage virtual networks.
   - **Cloud Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure application responsiveness and availability.
   - **Cloud CDN**: Content Delivery Network for delivering content to users with low latency and high data transfer speeds.

4. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**:
   - **Cloud IAM**: Allows you to manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource.

5. **Developer Tools**:
   - **Cloud Build**: Provides a fully managed continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that runs on Google Cloud.
   - **Cloud Source Repositories**: Hosted private Git repositories for storing, managing, and tracking changes to code.

These basic infrastructure services form the foundation for building and deploying applications on Google Cloud Platform, providing essential computing, storage, networking, and development tools to support a wide range of use cases.
